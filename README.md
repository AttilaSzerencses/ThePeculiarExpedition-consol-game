# ThePeculiarExpedition-consol-game
This is the peculiar expedition consol game, so it has no GUI. It was written in Java. This game is an older project. I made in 2021, and I'm uploading now. This was a school project.

You can find the game descreption pdf file: "Game description.pdf" in the folder. I made this game in Idea, and I used unicode charachters. It could be a problem, if you use another program to run.


Shortly about the game(you can find the long description in the pdf):

The game language is Hungarin.

You can add your own map into your game.

You can choose the number of the enemies.

You are an explorer. You have to find the gold pyramid on the map, and bring it back to the ship. After that, you can start the next level. In the game, you can get teammeats and they give you bonuses. There are 5 map and thats mean 5 level. 

You can sleep on the ship, and your energy is recharged. If you energy is zero, there is 8% chanche of losing your teammate, if you have. If you don't have teammates, there is 8% chanche to lose game. You recharg your energy with food also.

Movement has a cost that reduces your energy. There are map cells where this cost is bigger than normal. Normal movement cost is 1.

You can buy items in the villages or the beggining of the map. You start the game with 250 gold, this is the money in the game.

There are different items: Meat, Chocolate, Machete, Drug, Whisky, Torch, Rope,Glass ball, Fruit.

The map has different cells: lakes, seas, mountains, jungel, the ship, the gold pyramid, caves, altars, and grass.

You can't move on lake cell, sea cell, mountain cell. If you move to ship cell you can sleep, or if you have the gold pyramid you can go to the next level.

There is a bigger movement cost on the jungel cell, if you don't have macheta. 

On the cave cell and altar cell you can find treasure, it can be sold on the ship. If you step on this cells there is a chanche to get curse. But unfortunatly the curse is not programmed.
